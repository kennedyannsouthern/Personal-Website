          <p className="text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I am a data analytics professional with a strong foundation in biochemistry and public health. My mission is to use data to improve decision-making and promote healthier, more sustainable outcomes across industries.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Growing up in a small Midwestern town, I developed a deep appreciation for nature and lifelong curiosity about how the world works. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, kayaking, skiing â€” anything that connects me to the outdoors. I also value learning through books, film, and new experiences that broaden my thinking.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-400 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I believe data can be a powerful force for good. I am committed to a career that blends scientific thinking with data-driven strategy, always seeking opportunities to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact in health, science, and beyond.
